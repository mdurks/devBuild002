                    <p>Since April 2015 you no longer have to buy an annuity with your pension funds. In fact, all restrictions on your pension pot will are removed and you will have total freedom over how you withdraw your money.</p>

As is the case now, 25% of your money can be withdrawn free of any income tax.  The remaining 75% of your money will be subject to income tax at your highest marginal rate. You can withdraw it all at once or in stages.</p>

            <p>Trustees will not, in any circumstances, allow any loans to be made to a Member from the Scheme or his Member’s Personal Account. In addition, such payments meet the requirements set out in the Finance Act 2004.</p>  
            <p>In addition, the Trustees will not take any steps or allow any steps to be taken by a Member which may be in the context of potential Pension Liberation. Accordingly, the Trustees will not implement a request by a Member to transfer all or part of the value of his Member’s Personal Account to an arrangement which the Trustees have reason to believe is designed to facilitate Pension Liberation.</p>

            </h3>

            <p>The Pensions Act 1995 requires the Trustees to agree a Statement of Investment Principles in consultation with the Scheme’s investment advisors and the Principal Employer. This document sets out the principles governing how decisions about investment must be made. The Statement can be found in the latest Report and Accounts which can be found in the <a href="#Useful-documents">Useful documents</a> section of this website.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>From 6 April 2016 the government is changing the way in which State Pensions are calculated.  If you reached State Pension age prior to 6 April 2016 you will not be affected by the changes.  The changes will apply to:</p>
            <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>men born on or after 6 April 1951</li>
                <li>women born on or after 6 April 1953</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For people reaching State Pension age prior to 6 April 2016, the State Pension is made up of two elements - the Basic State Pension and the Additional State Pension (known as the State Second Pension).  The government is making changes to simplify this and introduce a single-tier structure.</p>
            <p>In addition, as part of the government's changes to State Pensions, from 6 April 2016 it will no longer be possible for defined benefit pension schemes to contract out of the Additional State Pension.</p>
            <p>Much like the two-tier State Pension that applied prior to 6 April 2016, the amount of single-tier pension people will receive will depend on the level of National Insurance contributions they have made.  You can requst a statement from the government which will confirm your National Insurance record.  To request a statement please see <a href="http://www.gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record">www.gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record</a>.</p>
            <p>Until 5 April 2017, anyone over State Pension age by April 2016 will be able to apply to make a "Class 3A voluntary contribution" to top up their State Pension.  You can find out more at <a href="http://www.gov.uk/state-pension-topup">www.gov.uk/state-pension-topup</a>.</p>
            <p>If you are 50 or over you can request a personalised new State Pension statement at <a href="http://www.gov.uk/check-state-pension">www.gov.uk/check-state-pension</a></p>
            <p>To help you understand how these changes will affect you the government has published a series of factsheets, tools and videos that can be found at <a href="http://www.gov.uk/yourstatepension">www.gov.uk/yourstatepension</a></p>
            <p>We recommend you make sure you're aware of what the changes mean for you and your retirement.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>If you get divorced we may be required to allocate or pay part of your retirement or death benefits to your ex-spouse to comply with any court order requiring this.</p>
            <p>This can happen even if you are already receiving a pension. Part of your pension will then belong to your former spouse, who must then transfer the value of it to another pension arrangement. This process is known as ‘pension sharing’.</p>
            <p>If you are getting divorced it is important that you review your <a href="http://www.btpensions.net/contacts/contact-details">Expression of Wish Form</a> and seek legal advice as the options can be complex.</p>
            <p>If you need detailed information about the value of your benefits in connection with a divorce, you will need to contact the Trustee.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>You can leave Forbes Retirement Ltd employment and ask for your pension to be paid at any time from age 55. If not an employee of Forbes Retirement Ltd with the agreement of The Trustee, at any time from age 55, you may take your tax free lump sum.</p>

            <p>You should provide your beneficiary details in the Application Form. Your spouse/beneficiaries should contact the Administrator. They will liaise with the Corporate Trustee and Investment Manager to make payment of the return of the fund value.</p>
            <p>The pension you may be eligible to receive will depend on the members nominated beneficiaries.</p>
            <p>Notification of the death of a Member</p>
            <p>In order to confirm and set up any benefits that may be payable you will be required to provide the following documentation:</p>
            <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>An original copy of the member’s death certificate;</li>
                <li>An original copy of your ID;</li>
                <li>An original copy of your marriage certificate or certificate of civil partnership;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We would recommend that any original documents being posted should be done so using the Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed service. All documents will be returned to you using this means.</p>
            <p>Upon receiving confirmation of any benefits payable you may be required to complete and return a few forms necessary to set up and arrange the payment of any benefits due.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>There are a number of State benefits to which you, as a pensioner, may be entitled.  This page only gives a brief summary of some of these benefits. If you are coming up to retirement or have recently retired, you will usually be sent an invitation to claim your State benefits when you are four months away from State Pension age.  You can check your State Pension age online at <a href="http://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age">www.gov.uk/state-pension-age</a>.</p>
            <p>If you don't receive an invitation to claim, and you are within four months of your State Pension age, you can call the Pensions Service (part of the Department for Work and Pensions) on 0800 731 7898 and they will send you an invitation. You can also do this online at <a href="http://www.gov.uk/claim-state-pension-online">www.gov.uk/claim-state-pension-online</a>.</p>
            <p>Make sure you do this as soon as possible to ensure you receive your first payment on time. Further details on State Pensions are available on the government's website at <a href="http://www.gov.uk/browse/working/state-pension">www.gov.uk/browse/working/state-pension</a>. In addition to your State Pension, some typical benefits to which pensioners may be entitled include:</p>

            <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>Pension and Pension Credit - State Pension, Pension Credit and Savings Credit.</li>
                <li>Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit - local authority benefits that assist those on a low income.</li>
                <li>Special benefits depending on personal and other circumstances - such as Winter Fuel Payments, Community Care Grants, Budgeting loans, Funeral and Bereavement Payments</li>
                <li>Disability related benefits - Attendance Allowance, Carer's Allowance, War Disablement Pensions, War Widows' or Widowers Pensions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note this is not a complete list. You can find out more about these and other benefits at <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk">www.direct.gov.uk</a>.</p>

                <a name="New-State-Pension" class="anchorDestination">New State Pension</a>
            </h3>
            <p>There is a new flat-rate (single-tier) State Pension that has been introduced which has replaced the basic State Pension and additional State Pension. The full new State Pension will initially be £155.65 per week. The amount will be based on your National Insurance contributions history and individual circumstances.</p>
            <p>If you reached your State Pension Age before 6 April 2016, you will receive a benefit based on the Pre 6 April 2016 system.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>The Forbes Retirement Benefits Scheme provides tax benefits for you while you are building up your pension - your contributions (up to certain limits) receive tax relief at the highest rate you pay, returns on investments (i.e. investment income) are not subject to tax and, when you retire, you may take a tax-free cash lump sum within certain limits. However, when you start receiving your pension, it is subject to income tax in the same way as salaries.</p>
            <p>Indeed, your tax situation may become a bit more complicated if you have different types of income from a variety of sources - savings, sale of property, various pension schemes, insurance policies that have matured or unit trusts, and so on. As always, whether and how much you pay in income tax will depend on the level of your income and other personal circumstances.</p>
            <p>The tax you pay depends on your taxable income in the tax year and includes:</p>
            <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>your state retirement (old age) pension;</li>
                <li>private pensions and AVCs;</li>
                <li>gross interest from a bank or building society;</li>
                <li>dividends from shares and UK authorised unit trusts;</li>
                <li>any earnings from a job or business; and</li>
                <li>income from property.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is not an exhaustive list and you can check the <a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs">HMRC website</a> for a complete and up-to-date picture. If you want more information about tax allowances and rates, you can get current details and further useful information by visiting the <a href="http://www.gov.uk/tax-national-insurance-after-state-pension-age">pensioner section of the HMRC website</a>.</p>

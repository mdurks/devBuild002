            <p class="para--large">The Forbes Retirement Benefits Scheme is an Occupational Pension Scheme sponsored by Forbes Retirement Limited and registered with HMRC and the Pensions Regulator.</p>

            <p>The Forbes Retirement Benefits Scheme was designed and registered following the latest pension regulations and guidance being implemented and satisfies the new rules.</p>

            <p>The Scheme is managed by Warwick & Eaton, who are responsible for the day to day control and administration of the Scheme. The Corporate Trustee performs its function entirely for the benefit of the members.</p>

            <p>The Trustee is Forbes trustees Limited.</p>

            <p>The Sponsoring Employer is Forbes Retirement Limited.</p>

            <p>We do not offer advice and recommend you seek advice from an appropriately qualified financial adviser. </p>

            <p>We cannot offer any return of funds below age 55 unless you are in serious ill health.</p>

            <p>You will receive an annual retirement benefit statement, which will provide you with the current valuation of your investment in the Scheme and also provide you with a projection of your entitlements at retirement. </p>

            <p>The Scheme Trust Deed and Scheme Rules, the Annual Corporate Trustee Report and the annual audited accounts are available on request.</p>

            <p>In the event of your death, your beneficiaries will be entitled to a death benefit and we ask that you provide the Corporate Trustee with details of your nominated beneficiary/beneficiaries.</p>

            <h3 class="heading--three">Retirement – Current Rules</h3>

            <p>Upon retirement, you will have the option of a tax-free cash sum of up to 25% of your fund’s investment value, together with the ability to purchase a pension payment for yourself, your spouse or your dependents. All pensions will be secured by way of an annuity and you may select the provider you prefer.</p>

            <h3 class="heading--three">Retirement – New Rules</h3>
            <p>From April 2015 you will no longer have to buy an annuity with your pension funds. In fact, all restrictions on your pension pot will be removed and you will have total freedom over how you withdraw your money.</p>
            <p>Under the new rules you will be able to access your entire pension after the age of 55. As is the case now, 25% of your money can be withdrawn free of any income tax.  The remaining 75% of your money will be subject to income tax at your highest marginal rate. You can withdraw it all at once or in stages.</p>

            <p class="para--border">The recent change to Pension legislation has led to a vast array of new options being available to both businesses and Individuals.  We fully understand the need for full due diligence and we welcome any questions you or your financial advisor may have. To ask any questions and to complete your due diligences on the Forbes Retirement Benefits Scheme please contact us. We will provide you the factual answers to your questions.</p>

            <h2 class="heading--two">How your fund is invested</h2>

            <h3 class="heading--three">Listed investments</h3>

            <p>The scheme offers its members a balanced investment strategy. The majority of assets will be invested in listed funds and actively managed by appropriately experienced and regulated companies. The remainder of the funds will be invested in alternative investment schemes and products to provide diversification and access to potentially higher returning investment opportunities.</p>

            <h3 class="heading--three">Alternative investment schemes/products</h3>

            <p>The Scheme will invest a proportion of funds into alternative investments, products and/or funds which provide a fixed rate of return. The intention will be to gain access to potentially higher returning investment opportunities, increase the value of the invested fund and to provide members with a diversified portfolio of investments. </p>

            <h3 class="heading--three">Investment selection</h3>

            <p>Alternative investments will meet the Scheme investment principles before being considered as an addition to the investment portfolio. Our investment committee are always reviewing new investment opportunities to determine if they are in the best interests of our investors by bench-marking the opportunity against our investment principles. The investment committee is formed with representatives from the different professionals in the team and leading industry experts selected from the relevant field.</p>

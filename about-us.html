            <h2 class="heading--two">About Us</h2>

            <p class="para--large">The reason most of us take out a Life Policy is to protect our loved ones, giving us that 'peace of mind', leaving them a payout in the event of our death. An individual could usually spend anything up to 40 years paying into one single Life Policy and receive nothing back for themselves.</p>

            <p>This is why we had created our unique Life Cover.  We want our clients to be able to have security for their family and also benefit themselves. After just 10 years you could get all of your premiums back and treat yourself to that holiday you had been waiting for or that new car you had been looking at.</p>

            <p>Your refund could be used for any purpose at all, especially if you have children or a family that you want looking after.</p>

                    <p class="heading-three text-center darkBlueTxt">A</p>
                    <p>If you make no claims after 10 years you will receive a full refund on all of your premiums.  This is a £3,000 refund.  We take no charges ourself and you certainly don't pay any tax on this money.</p>

                    <p class="heading-three text-center darkBlueTxt">A</p>
                    <p>In the event of your death your beneficiary would receive a £10,000 lump sum payout.  They would not be taxed on this money and we would also not add any fees onto this payout, such as Soliciting, Inheritance or Tax fees.</p>

                    <p class="heading-three text-center darkBlueTxt">A</p>
                    <p>To qualify for the policy you'll need to be under 60 years of age, in a form of employment and also have never suffered a serious illness.  If you are unsure whether your illness would be classed as serious under our terms just give us a call on 01752 XXXXX.  You will be able to speak to an advisor who will immediately check for you.</p>
